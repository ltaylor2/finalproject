# Ontogenetic Phylogenetics, and the Evolution of Delayed Plumage Maturation in Manakins

## Minimum Viable Analysis Description
For this checkpoint, I have developed an initial process for coding and wrangling plumage characters across and within taxa and performed a symmetric unordered ancestral state reconstruction in RevBayes given a preliminary tree. Character "alignment," ancestral state reconstruction, and plots are all automated by the bash script ```mva.sh```.

### Plumage Characters
Plumage characters are most intuitively coded as "patches": a red crown, an elongated rectrix, etc. But this qualitative coding regime is both convenient *and* necessary. This is because plumage characters are not individual developmental units that can be parsed on a universal and generalized "bird." Instead, a plumage character is a unit of dynamic *covariation* between different avian appendages and sub-appendages. Prum and Dyke (2003) dubbed this unit of covariation a "metamodule," and made clear that it is not reducible to any individual underlying phenotypic process (e.g., made clear that it is nothing like a "gene"). Here are two examples that illustrate this problem.

Golden-winged Manakins (*Masius chrysopterus*) clearly have a yellow wingpatch. This wing patch is not the result of a color aligned with any particular feather tract (pterlyae), a color aligned with any particular feather, or a color aligned with any particular barb. Instead, the presence of a coherent wing patch here is due to carotenoid deposition in *individual barbules* that, first, hook with other barbules of different barbs on the same feather to form a flat patch within a broader vane and, second, correspond with *individuals barbules* engaging in the same phenomena of covariation on different feathers to form a coherent flat patch across vanes [as Prum and Dyke (2003) note, it is also both telling and exciting that a yellow patch is developed in the same way on the rectrices of these birds!]. As far as I can tell, recognizing this yellow patch as a character seems feasible with one of four strategies: (1) establish a data structure which contains information about all individual barbules within a bird, and then aggregating patterns of covariation across those barbules; (2) establish a data structure which contains the relevant developmental signaling information through which feathers develop across the body of each bird; (3) look at the wing of the bird, and see that part of it looks like a yellow patch. I have chose the latter strategy.

As a second illustration, consider the delayed plumage maturation sequence of the Long-tailed Manakin (*Chiroxiphia linearis*). In their second predefinitive plumage stage (bottom left in the image below), young males have a black mask. The presence of this black mask as a plumage character is a product of covaration between black feathers *and* green feathers. Just as the mask is not present as a character from ages 0-15 months because some feathers are green rather than black, the mask is also not present as a character from 27 months onwards because some feathers are *black rather than green*.

These "disappearing" developmental features push me forward in two ways. First, I was previously confident that "developmental dependency" would instill a necessary constraint on a comparative analysis of developmental characters because, for example, a young bird could not have a character that was more elaborate than, or absent in, an older bird of the same taxon. I can no longer defend this claim, which simplifies my analysis of character evolution by removing the need for an underlying hierarchical markov model structure to trait inter-dependence. Second, the idea that developmental trajectories cannot be simply summarized by a continuous process of "accumulation" pulls us away from the classical understanding of the relationship between ontogeny and phylogeny (e.g., Gould 1977, Alberch et al. 1979) as merely an issue of developmental *rate* and developmental *period*

Although coding all of these characters rigorously and reliably will require more thought, for this checkpoint I have attempted to code the obvious plumage patches of a handful of manakin species in the Ilicurini subclade of manakins (including genera such as *Masius* and *Chiroxiphia*). I combined published literature reports with encyclopedic entries and images available from [The Birds of the World](https://birdsoftheworld.org/bow/home) database. Citations for each of the 15 initial taxa are listed in the table below.

For each taxon, I reviewed the predefinitive and definitive plumage stages. These stages are aligned across all taxa due to the single annual, and presumably homologous, molts that produce them with the same timing relative to the breeding seasons. For each individual, I coded the presence of plumage patches with one of three states: 0, 1, or 2. A character state of 2 indicates the presence of a fully-developed plumage patch (either color or structure), while a character state of 1 indicates the presence of a patch which is shows variation within a patch, variation across individuals, or lesser elaboration of the same structures present in a subsequent patch.

For example, here is the first pass at coding the plumage patches of *Chiroxiphia linearis*:
|Character|S1|S2|S3|S4|
|---------|--|--|--|--|
|Crown|1|1|2|2|
|Rectrices [inner elongated]|1|1|1|2|
|Mask|0|1|0|0|
|Body|0|0|1|2|
|Mantle|0|0|1|2|
|Remiges|0|0|1|0|
|Rectrices [color]|0|0|1|0|

Other taxa have simpler plumage characters and developmental trajectories. For example, here a first pass at coding the plumage patches of *Corapipo gutturalis* (note again the disappearing mask):
|Character|S1|S2|
|---------|--|--|
|Throat|2|2|
|Mask|2|0|
|Body|0|2|

The last plumage stage for each individual taxon is taken as that taxon's "definitive plumage." The set of plumage characters is then filled in to equal the maximum stage across all taxa. For example, *Chiroxiphia linearis* has four stages whereas *Corapipo gutturalis* only has two. After aligning all taxa with this maximum, the coding for *C. gutturalis* is filled in with the definitive plumage:
|Character|S1|S2|S3|S4|
|---------|--|--|--|--|
|Throat|2|2|2|2|
|Mask|2|0|0|0|
|Body|0|2|2|2|

The full matrix is then aligned across all taxa. All missing characters are coded as 0, giving a complete character matrix of, for example:

|Taxon|Body_S1|Body_S2|Body_S3|Body_S4|...|
|-----|-------|-------|-------|-------|---|
|*Chiroxiphia linearis*|0|0|1|2|...|
|*Corapipo gutturalis*|0|2|2|2|...|
|...|...|...|...|...|...|

Understanding these plumage characters will require lots of additional (and much more careful!) work, but this is a start!

### Backbone Phylogeny
A well-resolved genetic phylogeny of the entire manakin family Pipridae is pending, and we are contacting that research group in hopes of obtaining access. For this checkpoint, I used single subtree obtained the [BirdTree](Birdtree.org) database from Jetz et al. (2012).

### Ancestral State Reconstruction
I used [RevBayes](https://revbayes.github.io/) to perform a symmetric unordered ancestral state construction across all of the independent plumage characters. This analysis uses the very simple Mk model (Lewis 2001) with the three states for all plumage characters. The corresponding rate matrix ($Q$) is thus a symmetric 3x3 transition matrix governed by a single parameter ($\mu$).

The code for this preliminary RevBayes analysis is available in ```Scripts/mcmc_ase_mk.Rev```. For a simple start to the analysis, I ran two independent chains of 500,000 iterations each with a thinning of 500 and a burn-in of 25%.

We can quickly check that this analysis is starting to click together by viewing parameter estimate distributions and some preliminary character estimations. First, I can see that the single model parameter ($\mu$) is already mixing nicely within and across chains.

And I can view the parameter distribution across the posterior of both chains:
![Density plot for ($\mu$) parameter](Figures/dens_mu.png)

Finally, I can start to view the ancestral state reconstructions. Here is the tree annotated with the states for just the "Crown" plumage patch (S1-S2-S3-S4 at each node). Green dots indicate a character state of 0, Yellow indicates a state of 1, and Red indicates a state of 2.

Kinda neat!
